COMP 412, Fall 2022

The lab2 autograder is similar to the lab1 autograder.
You unpack the tar file into a directory. It will create a subtree named
"l2ag".  Inside l2ag, you place your tar archive file in the directory
TarFileGoesHere and then execute ./RunGrader

RunGrader will leave a log file and a set of files in the results directory.
The log file should list all of the data for you lab, run on a subset of 
the testing files.

Scores are expressed as a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) that indicates
the fraction of points foro that category (correctness, effectiveness, 
scalability) that the lab would receive.

The results/Scores.txt file is a tab-separated file of the same scores.

-------------------------------
If you include multiple tar archives, each will be scored.
The "comp412" tar file uses lab2_ref.
