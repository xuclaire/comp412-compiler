COMP 412, Fall 2022

The lab2 autograder is similar to the lab1 autograder.

TO MAKE THIS WORK IN YOUR DIRECTORY:

1. Unpack the tar file. It will create a directory l2ag.
2. Go into the l2ag/auto_grade directory.
3. Edit auto_grade.py and change the setting of the variable "base_dir" 
   so that it has the path name to the directory containing the RunGrader
   script.  "base_dir" must end in a slash ("/").

4. To run the autograder, place your tar archive file in the directory
   TarFileGoesHere. Then, invoke the script "./RunGrader".  Results are
   written into the log file and into the file "./results/Score.txt".


RunGrader will leave a log file and a set of files in the results directory.
The log file should list all of the data for you lab, run on a subset of 
the testing files.

Scores are expressed as a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) that indicates
the fraction of points foro that category (correctness, effectiveness, 
scalability) that the lab would receive.

The results/Scores.txt file is a tab-separated file of the same scores.

-------------------------------
If you include multiple tar archives, each will be scored.
The "comp412" tar file uses lab2_ref.
